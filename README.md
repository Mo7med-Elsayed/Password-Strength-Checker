# Password-Strength-Checker
A password strength checker to make brute-forcing harder.

### The main standards for a strong password
1. Length: 12-16 characters or more.
2. Complexity: Combine uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
3. Uniqueness: Never reuse passwords across different accounts.
4. Randomness: Avoid names, dates, sequences (abcd, 1234), keyboard patterns (qwerty), or personal details (birthdays, pet names).

### How to Run
